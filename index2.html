         <h2>Do you think Indian girls really try to convince their parents to let them marry their boyfriends? Why?</h2>
         <p>
           I have seen that most Indian girls always argue with their parents about almost everything . They get their way with books, clothes,
                                    education , employment, enjoyment etc. Suddenly however, every Indian girl wants to listen to her parents before getting married! Is it
                                     because of the fact that the guy of their parents' choice in most cases is always, good-looking , well-settled and has a higher paying job than her boyfriend
                                 N.B : I'm talking about girls who had boyfriends but did not marry them because their parents did not like them or allow them.
